- Approx. completion time: **1 hour**
- Deliverables: **1 HTML file, 1 CSS file, 1 JS file**

**Use Javascript keyboard events so that when a key is pressed a circle shows up randomly on the screen.**

- *Fork this repository.*
- Write an event listener in Javascript that listens for `keydown`
- When the event is triggered create a brand new `<div>`
- Generate a random `left` and `top` coordinate for the `<div>` using `Math.random()`
- Place the `<div>` on the page in the random position.
- *Run it through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.*
